# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This README file provides an overview of the "Titanic Survival Prediction." This is designed to predict whether a person would survive or not in the event of the Titanic sinking. It utilizes various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to make these predictions.

## Introduction

The Titanic Survival Prediction System is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on several input features. It is a binary classification problem where the model determines whether a passenger would survive or not survive during the Titanic disaster.

## Dependencies

Before using the system, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided example notebook)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To use the Titanic Survival Prediction System, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the dependencies installed (see the Dependencies section above).
3. Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`TASK_2.ipynb`) to see a step-by-step example of how to use the system.

You can customize and integrate this system into your applications or workflows by following the code and procedures outlined in the notebook.

## Data

The data used for training and testing the model is typically sourced from the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including features like passenger class, age, gender, and survival status. 

## Model

The system employs a machine learning model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, to predict passenger survival. The model is trained on historical Titanic data, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics.

## Evaluation

The performance of the prediction model is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results provide insights into the model's ability to make accurate predictions about passenger survival.

## Conclusion

The Titanic Survival Prediction System is a valuable tool for estimating the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on socio-economic status, age, gender, and other relevant factors. It can be used for historical analysis, educational purposes, or as a starting point for more complex predictive modeling tasks.
